    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd QuizManagementSystem
    ```

3. **Set up your classpath for the required libraries:** Add the following line to your batch file or run it manually in the terminal.
    ```bash
    set classpath=commons-collections4-4.1.jar;poi-3.17.jar;poi-ooxml-3.17.jar;poi-ooxml-schemas-3.17.jar;xmlbeans-2.6.0.jar;.;
    ```

4. **Compile the Java files:**
    ```bash
    javac -d . *.java
    javac *.java
    ```

5. **Run the project using the provided batch file:**
    ```bash
    java Main_Frame
    ```

## How to Run
1. **Run the batch file:**
    Simply double-click on the `test.bat` file in your project directory. This will automatically compile and run the project.

    Alternatively, you can manually compile and run the project using the following commands:
